My first Mysql + App Inventor 2 project for my work place (half-way-house) to manage appointments and incidents.
In fact, it is also my daughter's first AI2 project.  She responsible for the front-end and I mainly responsible for the back-end.

With this project, I caught up with the App inventor, php, FTP, Mysql usage etc. and last but no least .... github.

We hope this project can make use of our mobile to save documents to database, voice input and fast retrival of documents and text records to reduce daily operation work load, reduce unnecessary error and improve quality of service.

Please feel free share our work at your end and feel free to contact me for any assistance.
